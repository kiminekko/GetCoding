# GetCoding
Created Repository and Readme file - 5.26.2022 â™¥kbc
Storage for the files created while working through "Get Coding!" for html/css/js. This will allow me to share it with others to review, provide feedback vs. stored locally only.
I will create, edit and finalize the files on my laptop before uploading them (committing) them here. All files I create during the Project will not be needed or even used in the Website/App/Game(s). I did add extra styling to give the project my own "personal touch" and who couldn't use CSS/JS practice? <br/>
(Author's Thoughts/Notes: Debating whether to include the mock-site I am creating as I read Shay Howe's Basic & Advanced HTML/CSS/JS eBook. It is less cute, but if I edit the content to give it my own spin I could use in my Portfolio. Save for when I begin a Framework? I need something thicker most likely, or try SQL/database experiment.)

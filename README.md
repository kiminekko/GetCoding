# GetCoding
Created Repository and Readme file - 5.26.2022 â™¥kbc
Storage for the files created while working through "Get Coding!" for html/css/js. This will allow me to share it with others to review, provide feedback vs. stored locally only.
I want to be able to work on this at home, or at work, or if I ever decide to travel. This will also give me GH experience without scathing comments from pro-devs (cause Slack can be harsh for newbies, I totally avoid it now; there are less toxic support communities for devs/programmers in training.
7.4.22-Uploaded the images I will need through chapter 2; I may have to download and upload more if needed.
